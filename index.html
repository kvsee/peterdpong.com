                        implemented to determine a current and future board score based on information such as corners, available moves and stability. Lastly a recursive
                        MiniMax algorithm looking roughly 3 moves ahead was implemented. 3 moves ahead was chosen as the project required a move to be selected within 1 second</p>

                        <p class="reg">This project was the largest that I have undertaken, it taught me a lot about how to work with a larger project by breaking up the code into 
                          different functions and version control. The challenge itself was exciting as I had to code the game from scratch then on top work on the AI to play. One of the skills
                          the project helped me work on was getting an idea and transferring into code. I was also able to get use to using the debugger more to fix and narrow down bugs in my code. 
                          It also taught me to not over-think certain problems as I spent multiple hours fixing specific
                          problems when I could have focus on improving it AI by implementing Alpha-Beta Pruning.
